# Queue
1. Queue is a linear data structure.
2. It follows the principle of First In First Out(FIFO). So first element entered in the array is the first element to be removed.
3. Unlike Stack, queue is open at the both end. One end is used for insertions whereas other end is used for deletion.
4. Endpoint for insert is called rear whereas endpoint for remove is called front
5. Examples
    - People waiting in a line to buy tickets
    - In computer system, jobs waiting to run, messages to be passed over the network, printing jobs waiting to be printed and so on.
    - Also stores user input like keystrokes, touchscreen touches, mouse clicks and microphone inputs

## Primary Operations
1. insert() or enqueue() - Insert the element from the rear end
2. remove() or dequeue() - Remove the element from the front end


## Secondary Operations
1. front() or peek() - Display the elements that is going to be deleted.
2. is_empty() - Return True if queue is empty else False
3. is_full() - Return True if queue is full else False
4. display() - Display all the elements of the queue

## Types of Queue
1. Simple Queue
2. Circular Queue
3. Priority Queue
