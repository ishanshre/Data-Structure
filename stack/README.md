# Stack Data Structure
1. Stack is a liner data structure.
2. It follows Last In First Out principle
3. Real Life Examples: backspace function in text editor, deck of cards, piles of books, piles of money and many more
4. Stack has only one end from which we push or pop
5. Inserting New element to the stack is push operation
6. Removing or deleting element from the stack is pop operation
7. Displaying the last element of the stack is called peek operation

## Primary Stack Operation
1. push() ------> Insert the element to the stack
2. pop() -------> Remove or delete the elements from the stack

## Secondary/Axuilary Stack Operation
1. peek() ------> Printing the last element of stack
2. size() ------> Total size of the stack
3. is_empty() --> Return True if stack is empty else false
4. is_full() ---> Return True if stack is full else false

## Stack Program Examples and Applications:
1. Reversing the Word, or any sets of data
2. Matching HTML and XML tags
3. Undo function in text editors
4. Infix to PostFix conversion 
5. Stack are used for backtracking and parenthesis matching

## Efficiency of Stack
1. Items in the stack can be pushed or poped in time complexity of order 1 i.e. O(1)
2. Time is not dependent on how many items are avaliable in the stack. No comparision is needed in stack

## Advantages of Stack
1. Stacks helps in managing data the follows LIFO principles
2. Stacks are used for systemetc Memory Management
3. Stack helps in efficient function management. When a function is called, local variable and other function parameters are stored in stack and automatically deleted once returned from the function
4. Elements in the stack do not corrupt easily. They are safe and reliable
5. Stack allows control over memory allocation and deallocation
6. It cleans up the objects automatically

## Disadvantages of Stack
1. Stack memory is of limited size
2. The total size of the stack must me define before
3. To many objects leads to stack overflow
4. Random accessing is not possible in stack
